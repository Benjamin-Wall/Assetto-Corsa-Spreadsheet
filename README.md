# Assetto Corsa Spreadsheet

This is an extremely simple project i did because i was trying to get back into Assetto Corsa drifting and noticed that the [Assetto Corsa Drifting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1rvoicuZ7oOyIwIyYyiQcMp3HMIPIoNXG5nvkfWptOmg/htmlview) google spreadsheet has been removed/deleted, this was saddening to me and many other people of the Assetto Corsa community as this spreadsheet was a go to place for all mods (cars, tracks, etc)/

## What i did

I used a service called the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web) and entered in the spreadsheet and clicked on the most latest snapshot, i then inspected element and copied all the data and put it into my own
html files, added some styling and i now have a somewhat working version of the spreadsheet.

# Live website

I will use GitHub pages to host the Database for anyone to use: https://benjamin-wall.github.io/Assetto-Corsa-Spreadsheet/
